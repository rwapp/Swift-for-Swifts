FWhether you have a garden, balcony pots, or access to shared space, there are always ways to make your space greener. If you don't have outdoor space, look out for your local community garden, or maybe even consider 'flower bombing' some nearby empty land. If youâ€™re unsure what to grow, checkin  with local nature organisations for plants that are recommended in your area. And if you are growing, be sure to stay away from pesticides that kill off the insects that swifts hunt."
